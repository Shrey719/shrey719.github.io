        <h1># So whats a bootloader</h1>
        Because backwards compatibility, it is a right pain in the ass to get modern features working - so thats the first thing I did <br>
        <br>
        A bootloader sounds fancy, but in reality its any file that is 512 bytes long, runs in an infinite loop, and has the last two bytes as the magic number 0xaa55
        <br>
        A simple bootloader could be something like 
        <br><br>
        org 0x7c00<br>
        <br>
        bits 16
        <br>
        jmp $   
        <br>
        times 510-($-$$) db 0<br>              
        dw 0xaa55<br>

        <br>
        Since it would be complicated to explain how the GDT and Long mode work, im not going to (am lazy) <br>
        <br>
        Basicaly, those two allow you to use stuff like 32 and 64 bits and a higher level langauge like C<br>
        <h1> # Printing to the screen</h1>
        Actualy putting text on the screen is actualy a LOT easier than it sounds
        <br>
        First, you would need a buffer to keep track of where to print to the screen <br> 
        What I did was just make a varible called 'buf' and use this code to print a character to the screen
        <p>
            void print_char(char c) {<br>
                <p class="ind">*(char*)(0xb8000+ 2)= c;></p> 
                <p class="ind">buf_amnt = buf_amnt + decinc;</p>         
            }<br>
        </p>
        The reason I write to the adress 0xb8000 is because it is where vram starts (vram is the stuff displayed on the screen)
        <br>
        
        <h1># Keyboard input</h1>
        <br>   
        Doing keyboard input (atleast the easy way) is NOT fun 
        <br>
        First, make an enum of EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER that can be typed on your keyboard 
        <br>
        <br>
        Then, make a function processing EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER that can be typed on your keyboard
        <br>
        This is what it would look like 
        <br>
        enum {<br>
         <p class="ind">   //every damm character </p> 
        }<br><br>
        char namingthingsarehard() { <br>
            <p class="ind"> // ever damm character </p>
        } <br> <br>

        char getchar() { <br><br>
            <p class="ind">            return namingthingsarehard(some_function_to_read_from_port(0x60))
            </p>
        } <br>
